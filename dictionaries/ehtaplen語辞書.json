ライセンスはcc0で、自由に転載、再配布、改変、派生言語の作成が行えます。このサイトがもし将来閉鎖することがあればehtaplen辞書の再配布・再ホスティングすることを希望します。  - ehtaplenとは  \nehtaplenはVSO-NA-NG語順（動詞・主語・目的語順、名詞・形容詞順、名詞・所有格順）であり、格をもたず語順によって統語が決まる孤立語です。\nehtaplenの動詞は全てsで終わり、名詞は全てnで終わります。形容詞は、名詞を修飾する動詞として、副詞は動詞を修飾する動詞として扱われ、両方とも辞書の品詞見出しでは動詞に含まれるので注意してください。例えば形容詞「かわいい」を引きたいときは「Aはかわいい」という意味の動詞knisを引き、knisを関係詞として使って名詞を修飾してください。また、副詞「速く」を引きたいときは、「Aは速い」という動詞chelisを引き、chelisを動詞のあとに続けて副詞として使ってください。\nehtaplenはできたてほやほやの人工言語であり基礎的な語彙であっても辞書の綴りが頻繁変わるかもしれないので注意してください。\n \n ## 辞書を引くための知識\n - 動詞や名詞の末尾にあるtは並列表現を表すのでtを外して検索してください\n例： pant niwon 「人と魚」の辞書見出しはpan, niwon\n- 動詞の末尾sの前には時制、相、法を表す接辞が入っていることがあるので、接辞を取り除いて検索してください\n例: ons A B「AはBであった」の辞書見出しはos\n- 接辞を付ける前の動詞の基本形の最後の母音は、動詞のとる項を表し、母音を変化することで動詞を派生させますが、動詞によっては派生の全パターンが登録されていないことがあります。その場合は母音を変えて検索してください。\n例：feles A B「AはBを燃やす」という動詞が見つからないときは、代わりにfelis A 「Aは燃える」を検索してみる\n  \n##
